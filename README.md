# Handwriting-recognition
The code for handwritten numbers recognition using PyTorch, written in Python. There are 2 .py files in the repo, 
the first one create_model.py is to create and save the model in .pt file to a directory.
The second one handwriting_mnist.py would call the .pt model and predict the input image captured from the camera. \
Prediction output will be showed on the terminal.\
MNIST dataset is used (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  \
